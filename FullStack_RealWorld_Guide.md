# 🧠 Becoming an Industry-Level Full Stack Developer (Beyond Just Code)

This guide outlines everything you need to **become a complete Full Stack Web Developer** — not just by knowing technologies like React, Node, Mongo, but by understanding **real-world practices**, system design, DevOps, security, and how actual companies work in team-based environments.

---

## 📌 Part 1: Core Knowledge Beyond Technologies

### 🧠 1. System Design Concepts
- Client-Server Architecture
- REST vs GraphQL
- Monolith vs Microservices vs Modular Monorepo
- Scalability, Load Balancing, Caching
- CDN, SSR vs CSR, Lazy Loading
- Rate Limiting, Queues (e.g., BullMQ)

---

### 🧾 2. Project Architecture & Code Structure
- Clean Code Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS
- Layered Folder Structure (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Shared Types, DTOs, Validation
- Environment Management (.env, dotenv)
- Code Splitting & Modularization

---

### 🛡️ 3. Security Best Practices
- HTTPS, CORS, CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection
- Auth: Cookie vs JWT vs OAuth2
- Password Hashing: bcrypt, argon2
- Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
- Helmet.js, rate limiting, IP filtering

---

### 🚦 4. API Design Principles
- REST naming conventions
- Versioning (`/api/v1/users`)
- Status Codes (`200`, `400`, `401`, `500`)
- Pagination, Filtering, Sorting
- Proper request/response format

---

### 🧪 5. Testing Knowledge
- Unit Tests (Jest, Mocha)
- Integration Tests
- E2E Tests (Cypress, Playwright)
- Test Pyramid Strategy

---

### 🐳 6. DevOps & Deployment Basics
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- VPS (Linux) setup with NGINX
- SSL (Let's Encrypt) & Domain Binding
- PM2 / systemctl process management

---

### 🧩 7. Git & Collaboration
- Git Branching Strategy (main/dev/feature)
- Pull Request + Code Review Flow
- Rebase vs Merge
- Git tags & release management

---

### 💬 8. Soft Skills
- Communication (English + Tech talk)
- Task Breakdown & Estimation
- Agile, Scrum, Jira/Notion usage
- Client Handling & Documentation

---

### 📚 9. CS Fundamentals (for Real Logic Building)
- Data Structures: Array, Object, Stack, Queue
- Algorithm Basics: Searching, Sorting
- Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
- Database Indexing, Joins, Normalization

---

### 📈 10. Analytics, Logging & Monitoring
- Winston / Morgan Logging
- Error Tracking: Sentry, LogRocket
- Usage Analytics: Google Analytics, PostHog

---

## 🔥 Bonus Skills:
- Stripe / SSLCommerz / Payment Gateway
- Third-party APIs (Google Maps, Firebase, OpenAI)
- Localization (i18n)

---

## 📌 Part 2: Real-World Development Workflow (Team Projects)

### ✅ Step-by-Step Real Workflow:

#### 1. Requirement Gathering
- Business team or client defines what features are needed
- Tools: Jira, Notion
- Developer understands features, clarifies doubts

---

#### 2. Planning & System Design
- Decide database models, API routes, frontend pages/components
- Tools: Whimsical, Figma, Draw.io
- Architecture Plan: Folder structure, auth strategy, deployment target

---

#### 3. Project Setup
- Git Repo + Branching strategy
- Frontend: Tailwind + shadcn/ui + React Query
- Backend: Express/NestJS + Folder Structure + Middlewares

---

#### 4. Sprint Planning & Task Division
- Tasks broken into stories (1–3 days of work)
- Assigned via Jira/Trello/Notion
- Examples:
  - “Create login API”
  - “Design user table UI + integrate API”

---

#### 5. Development Begins
- Frontend & backend work in parallel
- API testing with Postman / Swagger
- Features built one by one
- Each task pushed as PR with code review

---

#### 6. Testing & Bug Fixing
- Manual UI Testing
- Postman API Testing
- Optional: Unit + Integration tests (Jest/Cypress)

---

#### 7. Staging Deployment
- Upload to staging server (Vercel, Render, VPS)
- `.env.production` setup
- Final checks: responsive, fast, secure

---

#### 8. Production Deployment
- Backend: Deployed on VPS (NGINX + Docker/PM2)
- Frontend: Vercel or NGINX
- Domain + SSL via Let's Encrypt
- CI/CD for automated deploy

---

#### 9. Monitoring & Analytics
- Sentry, LogRocket for error tracking
- PostHog or Google Analytics for usage
- Uptime monitor for 24x7 alerting

---

#### 10. Maintenance & Feature Updates
- Bug fixes, small releases (`v1.0.1 → v1.0.2`)
- User feedback handling
- New features added using same cycle
